## 💡 Microsoft Fabric Challenge: Implement SCD Type 2 in Lakehouse 

### 🎯 Objective

Use PySpark in a Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse to implement Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD Type 2) to track changes in employee records over time.

### 🗂️ Scenario

Your company maintains an employee_master table with records such as name, department, and job title. Over time, employees may change departments or job titles. You need to track historical changes using SCD Type 2 logic in the dim_employee dimension table.


### ✅ Success Criteria

SCD Type 2 implemented correctly using PySpark.

No duplicate active records.

Correct handling of unchanged vs. changed rows.
